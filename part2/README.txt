The package is based on the robot localization package. It has a launcher called "launcher2.launch". This launcher starts multiple nodes, the ekf localization node, that fuses imu data and odometry data, then we have the nodes to compute the odometry given from the bag, and a node to change the frame id the imu data. The last one is the navsat node that fuses the previous odometry with the gps data and gives it's output on gps/filtered. The odom node, called "subs" publishes the calculated odometry on the topic "/computed_odometry", with frame id called "odom_frame" and child frame "base_link".Those parameters are also used in the configuration of the ekf localization node to set the base link, world and odom frame. There is also a complementary filter to filter the raw data of the imu sensor, the complementary filter takes data from the "imu/data_copied" topic and publishes on "imu/data".
All this data are fused to the gps through the navsat node which is set at 30 Hz. The node publishes the final data on the gps/filtered topic.Two static tf are also used to form the tf tree for the ekf and navsat node.
